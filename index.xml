      <title>No Kipple Please</title>
      <link>https://samdark.github.io/blog/no-kipple-please/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œKipple is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers or yesterday&amp;rsquo;s
homeopape. When nobody&amp;rsquo;s around, kipple reproduces itself. For instance, if you go to bed leaving any kipple around
your apartment, when you wake up the next morning there&amp;rsquo;s twice as much of it. It always gets more and more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s the First Law of Kipple,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Kipple drives out nonkipple.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT projects are much like the apartments mentioned in Philip K. Dick novel. They tend
to have kipple and, as with apartments, it grows every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed lots of projects and one of mistakes I often see is about kipple. It looks
minor compared to bugs or architecture mistakes but at the same time it affects both
project and development team significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So kipple exists. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s cryptic unneeded stuff which one hesitates to delete for
quite vague illogical reasons. Commented out code, files like &lt;code&gt;main.css_old&lt;/code&gt;, unused
methods, five different versions of jQuery, &lt;code&gt;// TODO:&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why kipple is both useless and bad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory&#34;&gt;Broken Windows Theory&lt;/a&gt; applies
well to IT projects. If it&amp;rsquo;s allowed not to clean up it&amp;rsquo;s OK to write code which is
of doubtful quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often developers comment out big chunks of CSS, JavaScript and HTML which are still
served to end user slowing page loading speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re actually reading commented out parts of code. It takes time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large number of unused files may and would confuse newcomers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is unpleasant to work with such kippled project. Feels like code is of a bad quality
even if architecture and code itself is OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile time may be increased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any version control system remembers everything you&amp;rsquo;ll delete. If there&amp;rsquo;s a need
you can always get it from there. If you fail to remember where it was, tag the commit.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that you may say that it&amp;rsquo;s not important and there&amp;rsquo;s no time for it but I highly
recommend trying it for a few months. You&amp;rsquo;ll see difference in both the project and
overall quality of the code your team produce.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finding Bug with Binary Search</title>
      <link>https://samdark.github.io/blog/finding-bug-with-binary-search/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2017 21:52:28 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://samdark.github.io/blog/finding-bug-with-binary-search/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once there&amp;rsquo;s a way to reproduce the issue we need to find code which causes it. Sometimes we&amp;rsquo;re getting totally stuck
for day feeling more and more depressed and, in the end, unable to think clear. Luckily, there&amp;rsquo;s a good way to
find bug even if you have no idea what caused it and even where to set a breakpoint for proper debugging. This way is
binary search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your code is under version control, you&amp;rsquo;re checking out fairly old commit and see if it works. If it works then you&amp;rsquo;re
checking out commit which is in the middle between commit which works and commit which does not and check again. When
there are no commits left in between you get the commit that broke it. If you&amp;rsquo;re using git you&amp;rsquo;re lucky since it has
built-in way to do it via &lt;code&gt;git bisect&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alike it could be done with HTML markup. If you have weird bug, delete half of the page HTML and see if issue is still there.
If it is then divide that HTML and check parts again. If it&amp;rsquo;s not then take other half for inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro is that you&amp;rsquo;ll certainly find what caused the bug for sure. Con is that it&amp;rsquo;s not so fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same method could be applied to anything. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s widely used in electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The History of Yii Framework</title>

&lt;p&gt;Yii is one of the long-living PHP frameworks out there constantly evolving with time
as PHP is enhanced more and more. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to know how it was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;prado&#34;&gt;Prado&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2004 Qiang Xue released first version of PRADO framework. He was inspired
by Apache Tapestry, Borland Delphi and Microsoft ASP.NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly at the same time Zend conducted a competition called &amp;ldquo;gophp5&amp;rdquo; to promote
just released PHP 5.0. Qiang re-implemented framework on PHP 5 and won the
competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time project was hosted at SourceForge. In the middle of 2005 Wei Zhuo helped
with i18n and l10n. Prado 2.0 was released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2005 it was decided to re-write framework again to include new cool features
inspired by Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0. In April 2006 version 3.0 was released. Starting
from it Prado team mostly on code quality and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRADO is still alive and used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;yii&#34;&gt;Yii&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2006 Qiang announced alpha version of Yii at PRADO forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December 3rd 2008 version 1.0.0 was out. Many ideas and some code were taken
from PRADO: ActiveRecord, i18n, l10n etc. More inspiration was from
RoR (convention over configuration, some AR features), symfony1 (filters,
plugins) and Joomla (modules, message translation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yii 1.0.0 was significantly faster than other frameworks with alike functionality
so community grew fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2010 Yii 1.1 was out. It had form builder, relational queries in AR,
ready to use unit-testing framework and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve joined Yii team in 2010. By the end of the year we were discussing Yii 1.2
while developing version 1.1. In may 2011 it was decided to use newer PHP versions
and fix architectural mistakes i.e. to do 2.0. First commit was made into then
secret repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2013 Yii 2.0 code was presented to public. In October 2014 first stable release
was out.&lt;/p&gt;

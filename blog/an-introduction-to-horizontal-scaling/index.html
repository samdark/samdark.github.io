<p>Web is an exciting place. Hundreds of startups are launched every day. Majority of what&rsquo;s launched is never getting
any popular. I was lucky to work on some projects which actually got really popular. These projects experienced significant
performance problems which were solved by scaling.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with the basics. Scaling is an ability to improve overall performance fast by adding more computing resources.</p>

<p>Either because of time contraints or other reasons optimizing code can be a bad option. In this case a solution is
adding more servers (horizontal scaling) or adding more resorces such as RAM, CPU, or disk space to an existing server
(vertical scaling).</p>

<h2 id="why-should-i-care">Why should I care?</h2>

<p>An important question usually asked at this point is &ldquo;why should I care if I have a single server and it works well&rdquo;?</p>

<p>The answer is that if you don&rsquo;t plan for the future popularity may destroy the service if it won&rsquo;t be able to serve
with acceptable performance.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-find-out">How to find out?</h2>

<p>There are two utilities, ApacheBench known as &ldquo;ab&rdquo; (part of <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache httpd</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/JoeDog/siege">siege</a>.
Both are helpful for checking how the service in question behaves under peak loads created by high traffic.
They are issuing many concurrent queries you define and measuring performance: requests per second, overall time to serve
all requests, etc.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how ApacheBench outputs results:</p>

<pre><code>$ ab -n 100 -c 2 http://example.com/

<p>In the above command arguments <code>n</code> is a number of queries to issue, <code>с</code> is how many queries should be done concurrently.</p>

<p>In case of Siege it&rsquo;s like the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ siege -b -c10 -t60S http://example.com/

** SIEGE 2.72
** Preparing 10 concurrent users for battle.
The server is now under siege...
Lifting the server siege...      done.

</code></pre>

<p>In the above command arguments <code>-t</code> is a number seconds to issue queries, <code>-с</code> is how many queries should be done
concurrently.</p>

<p>Both command outputs give us RPS, i.e. how many requests per second your server is able to process. Having the number you
may estimate how many users is that. There&rsquo;s no ready to use formula for this estimate becaue all projects are different
but it definitely worth checking this number in detail.</p>

<p>Another parameter is Response time. Time it takes from the beginning of the request to the end of response when it&rsquo;s
fully sent to end user. Again, reponse time may vary from project to project. Overall something like 300 ms is acceptable.
Higher response time is definitely a problem since these 300ms is the time server works. Additional time adds up for
rendering the page, loading images and styles. That is usually another 300-600 ms.</p>

<h2 id="ok-should-i-prepare-for-scaling-now">OK. Should I prepare for scaling now?</h2>

<p>It depends. Sometimes it&rsquo;s too early. If a project has stable slow growth and surpises are unlikely to happen
you may solve performance problems with updating software, doing obvious fixes in the code etc. Why not? For, example,
simply updating PHP may give you very significant performance gain. Installing and tuning Opcache gives a boost well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tip: In order to tune OpCache install one of GUIs for it. Personally I prefer <a href="https://github.com/amnuts/opcache-gui">opcache-gui</a>
  but any would do. Key metrics there are hits (how many times code was read from cache) and misses (how many times
  code was read from disk). Ideally, after executing whole project code hit rate should be 100%. If there are misses
  you should allocate more memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you&rsquo;re replacing Apache with nginx to save memory, turning on data cache etc. When easy optimizations are done you
start spending more and more time for less and less performance gain.</p>

<p>So in the end by doing easy performance optimizations you&rsquo;re not saving issue permanently but instead buying time
to prepare for scaling.</p>

<h2 id="don-t-assume">Don&rsquo;t assume</h2>

<p>A common mistake of tuning performance or scaling is doing it blidly without finding out why the service in question is
slow. It happens that after days of blind tuning you achieve nothing. Then you find out that a single index is missing
from your database. You add it and immediately performance is instantly excellent.</p>

<p>So the first rule is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t assume. Measure!&rdquo;. And in order to measure we need information.
If you have a performance problem, try to find an easy solution such as caching front page or turning on cache first.
When it&rsquo;s back to normal, take some time and set up more monitoring. It will show you what is really lacking. Fix the
issue and do it again in a week. In a steadily growing project you can&rsquo;t afford not to monitor and not no work
on performance constantly.</p>

<p>So what info usual monitoring provides us? High disk I/O, low memory, high CPU load, not enough bandwidth are quite
obvious. If may make sense to check for peaks daily because while average could be OK, at certain moments load could be
too high. Depending on the root cause, solution is diffent in each case. For example, to solve disk I/O problem of MySQL
you can either add another disk to the same physical server or set up a separate server for managing files separately from
database.</p>

<p>So obvious things are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Availability. Is the server alive?</li>
<li>Lack of resources: disk space, I/O, bandwidth, CPU load, etc.</li>
<li>Errors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="monitoring-resources">Monitoring resources</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of good tools for you:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mmonit.com/monit/">Monit</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.zabbix.com/">Zabbix</a></li>
<li><a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.serverdensity.com/">ServerDensity</a></li>
</ul>

<p>First four are installable tools. Fifth is a SaaS.</p>

<h3 id="monitoring-errors">Monitoring errors</h3>

<p>For errors it&rsquo;s great to use one of log aggregation tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://rollbar.com/">Rollbar</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">Sentry</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are obviously more but I&rsquo;ve tried only these two and settled down with Rollbar.</p>

<p>Usually one is writing everything to a log file and then checking it from time to time. Additionally it&rsquo;s common to send
emails or SMS messages with error. That&rsquo;s OK but only if you don&rsquo;t have much traffic. If you do and there&rsquo;s an error then
you&rsquo;ll get thousands emails and SMS messages in no time. It usually results in both mailbox overflow and total loss of
developer concentration. After some time he starts ignoring these messages.</p>

<p>Both services linked above are grouping alike error messages giving you nunber of occurences for each group and sorting
by the number of occurences. So you see what your bug fixing priorities are.</p>

<p>Sentry could be installed on your own server since it&rsquo;s OpenSourced. Rollbar is paid SaaS only. I absolutely love their
payments model since they&rsquo;re charging more if you have more errors. Additional reason to fix errors.</p>

<h3 id="parameters-to-check">Parameters to check</h3>

<p>RPS and Responce time. RPS is going down or response time goes up you need to take care of it.</p>

<p>Same a about number of processes, number of threads, queue sizes. If any of these are going up,
something is definitely wrong and you need to dig into it immediately.</p>

<p>You should pay attention to business side of things as well since monitoring could display
that everything is technically fine: response time is great. At the same time, you track
signups and signups number decreased a lot. In this case you should look for individual pages
to be rendered too slow or have problems.</p>

<p>For the purpose Google Analytics is good for
websites. Mixpanel is good for events of both deskop, mobile and websites.</p>

<p>Of course, you can set up your own solution but it saves time to use external services.</p>

<p>The project should be full with analyics so you always know what happens when instead of working
blindly.</p>

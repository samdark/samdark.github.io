<p>I was part of Stay.com for 7?? years. That was amazing time and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from the project
and the team. Unfortunitely, it&rsquo;s going to be shut down soon due to business reasons soon.</p>

<h2 id="team">Team</h2>

<p>When I&rsquo;ve joined the project I was least experienced guy in the team.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li>SVN → Git</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="basecamp-trello">Basecamp → Trello</h3>

<p>When I&rsquo;ve joined the team, BaseCamp was used. It was OK but something wasn&rsquo;t right. There were
no good overview and working with it was taking too much time. Then someone (I don&rsquo;t remember who was that)
suggested Trello. We&rsquo;ve tried it and never came back.</p>

<p>I think it was a perfect fit because all people in the team had experience with many issue tracking
and project management tools so creating a few boards and columns, naming them properly and being
elaborative yet precise while creating cards was natural for each team member.</p>

<h3 id="skype-slack">Skype → Slack</h3>

<p>Originally we were using Skype for both chatting and voice calls. Later we&rsquo;ve switched to Slack
for chats. Since Stay.com team was expanded a bit and actually became several teams: content managers,
web, android, iOS, marketing etc., Slack was a perfect fit. When work was intensive, we were
leaving chats we were not directly involved into thus removing unneeded interruptions.</p>

<p>Slack voice calls didn&rsquo;t go well in terms of sound quality and reliablity so we&rsquo;ve stayed on Skype
for that purpose.</p>

<ul>
<li>Logs + Jabber + emails → Rollbar (me)</li>
<li>AWS</li>
<li>bash for deployment etc.</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>vim, jetbrains IDEs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="designer-who-codes">Designer who codes</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got wonderful and very talented designer, Asgeir Hoem. He joined the project months before me.
Besides producing fine layouts, logos, icon fonts and other assets, he was doing several things
that were unusual:</p>

<ul>
<li>When he was saying &ldquo;Hey, I have a mock&rdquo;, often that meant that it&rsquo;s quite clean HTML with good
CSS and not perfect but functioal JavaScript part.</li>
<li>When he reported bugs he did that with annotated images and videos. T</li>
</ul>

<p>One day when everyone were too busy he checked out Android app source code, set up environment, fixed
layout and added some assets, successfully built it, verified and committed his changes. Took him a
few hours to figure things out.</p>

<p>Years later became CEO of the company.</p>

<h2 id="yii-1-1">Yii 1.1</h2>

<p>The project was started when there was no Yii 2.0 and we&rsquo;ve never migrated from 1.1. Even after
2.0 release and even years after it felt OK to work with. Well, it felt dated, of course, since
my hobby projects were mostly at 2.0 that&rsquo;s much superior. But overall it was fine.</p>

<h2 id="typescript-and-less">TypeScript and LESS</h2>

<p>At first, Stay.com web application was typical server-rendered website. Years passed and it started
to feel dated. It was decided to re-do in in form of an application so it feels like Android and iOS
apps and, at the same time is usable and simple.</p>

<p>Amount of JavaScript code and CSS grew every day and felt less and less maintainable. Thanks god
we&rsquo;ve checked LESS and TypeScript and decided to use these. Both gave us a huge boost in both
maintainability and cleanness of our code. LESS is probably not the best choice nowadays (as far
as I know, SASS is the current thing). TypeScript is a great choice nowadays.</p>

<h2 id="grunt">Grunt</h2>

<p>When we had a pretty much classical website with regular CSS and some JavaScript, there were no need
for complex build tool so we wrote our own in bash and PHP to combine and compress files. That build
tool ideas ended up in Yii 2.0 assets and asset builder concepts.</p>

<p>A switch to LESS and TypeScript required more advanced tools so it was decided to use Grunt. It&rsquo;s not
the best tool in terms of performance (Gulp is way faster) but it works well and there are many
ready to use recipes.</p>

<h2 id="android">Android</h2>

<p>I was also working on Android application along with Gurudutt Verma and Cutehacks. When web part was
more or less ready, we&rsquo;ve released it and fixed bugs discovered, I had plenty of time so it was
decided that, since I have Java past, it will be great for me to work on Android app. What can I say?
That was great 1,5 years.</p>

<p>Cutehacks are really good so I was learning a lot every day.</p>

<h2 id="golang">golang</h2>

<p>Originally we&rsquo;ve used ImageMagick to resize images and it was OK till we&rsquo;ve started work hard on
getting more users on board and exanding our content. Numbers of active users grew fast as well as
number of images. ImageMagick wasn&rsquo;s very fast and ate significant resources. Wei decided to try
implementing a simple image server using golang. It worked really well. Performance was exceptional,
response times improved and resource usage dropped.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a pro photographer but love to travel with a camera so I&amp;rsquo;m making some pictures from time to time. Some time ago I&amp;rsquo;ve started shooting in RAW and post-processing it to JPEG-s at home. After some practice I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get slightly better JPEG-s than camera was making automatically. Everything was well (except tons of unprocessed RAWs, of course) but after re-installing OS something went wrong. I was doing everything as before but resulting JPEGs were simply dull colored and greyish.</description>

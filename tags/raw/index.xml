      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a pro photographer but love to travel with a camera so I&amp;rsquo;m making some pictures from time to time. Some time ago
I&amp;rsquo;ve started shooting in RAW and post-processing it to JPEG-s at home. After some practice I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get slightly
better JPEG-s than camera was making automatically. Everything was well (except tons of unprocessed RAWs, of course) but
after re-installing OS something went wrong. I was doing everything as before but resulting JPEGs were simply dull
colored and greyish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research revealed that wrong color space and depth were set in processing software. I&amp;rsquo;m using Adobe Camera RAW but
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure alike settings are in other software as well. After setting color space to sRGB and depth to 16 bit
everything went back to normal. JPEGs became juicy again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wonder about the difference between color spaces, here&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://fstoppers.com/pictures/adobergb-vs-srgb-3167&#34;&gt;a good article by Zach Sutton about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

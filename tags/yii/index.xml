      <description>Just caught 500-error at YouTube. No one is safe from that, even the best projects but that&amp;rsquo;s not the point of the post. The thing is that the error page is more useful than majority of other error pages. Here&amp;rsquo;s why&amp;hellip;
What is different here is a long wall of &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo;. You can not display anything useful in production since it would allow hackers to crack your project easier. But it would have been great because searching for particular user-reported error is, sometimes, a big pain.</description>

 Why isn&amp;rsquo;t Yii 2.0 PSR-3 compatible? How do I use PSR-3 compatible logger in Yii 2.</description>

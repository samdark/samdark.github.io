      <description>This year my wife got Silhouette CAMEOÂ® 3 cutter as her birthday present. She and our whole family were happily using it to precisely cut various cool things until last month.
The problem We store the device in a separate room in order for children not to hurt themselves with sharp parts and carrying it to main room to actually cut things. After one of these transfers and turning CAMEO on LCD touch screen refused to react on touch.</description>
